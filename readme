w-log only looks at SELECT queries that are the result of normal page loads.  It does filter many
different queries out of view for a better look at the page load.  For a complete list
of your query log, you can query within phpMyAdmin using:

SELECT * FROM mysql.general_log

This will show you all queries.  w-log does truncate on each view, so refrain from displaying
while searching full results.
